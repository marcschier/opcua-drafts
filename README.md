# opcua-drafts

A scratch pad for **OPC UA specification drafts**.

This repository is a working area for authoring and iterating on draft OPC UA information models and companion specifications. It is intentionally informal: contents are experimental drafts used to explore modelling approaches, try out tooling, and prototype NodeSets before anything is proposed or released. Nothing here is normative, official, or final, and everything is subject to change or removal without notice.

## Layout

- `companion-specs/` — draft OPC UA companion specifications, one folder per domain.
  - `Generators/` — draft Companion Specification for electrical power **Generator Sets (GenSets)**: the information model (`Opc.Ua.Generators.NodeSet2.xml`), the NodeId assignments (`Opc.Ua.Generators.NodeIds.csv`), the specification document, and `tools/build_model.py` — a generator that emits the NodeSet, CSV, and reference tables from a single source of truth.

## Status

Draft / experimental. These drafts are not affiliated with, reviewed by, or endorsed by the OPC Foundation, and the use of `opcfoundation.org` namespace URIs is for prototyping only.
